## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Cannot login / Invalid credentials**

- Check if database was imported correctly
- Default password is `treasurer123` (MD5 hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99)

**2. Logo not displaying**

- Ensure `assets/images/logo.jpg` exists
- Check file permissions

**3. BIR form error: "Unknown column 'net_amount'"**

- Run the migration script: `update_bir_table.sql`
- Or manually add the column: `ALTER TABLE bir_records ADD COLUMN net_amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL;`

**4. Monthly Collections not showing manual entries**

- Ensure category names match exactly: "Tax Revenue", "Tax on Goods & Services", "Operating & Services", "Other"
- Check `monthly_manual_entries` table for correct entry_type values

**5. Dashboard chart not reflecting new data**

- Clear browser cache
- Check if manual entries exist in `monthly_manual_entries` table
- Verify entry_type values match expected categories
